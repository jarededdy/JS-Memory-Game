# JS-Memory-Game
A memory card game made using JavaScript

Clone the repo and open the file "Memory_Game.html" in your favorite internet browser.

Click on the grey tiles to reveal the color hidden on them. If you match two colors they will be removed from the board. If the two cards you reveal don't match, they will become gray again. Don't try too hard and remember the important thing is to have fun!
